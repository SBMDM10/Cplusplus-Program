**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project is a program that analyzes text records of a grocery store to determine sale amount of their various products. It needed to be able to read an input file (.txt.) to create a list of items sold for the day, then be able to display the list in an item - count format. An additional functionality is for the user to input a product and then have the list be searched and specifically return the count of that item. It was also neccessary to take the list and iterate through it to create a histogram of the items and their sale counts.

**What did you do particularly well?
I have become very proficient at making display menus utilizng C++, so I feel I did well there. I feel like I did well with how I setup the menu to cycle, wait 3 seconds, and wait for any key to continue. It is probably not the best handling of such, but I am thinking about how to make the experience for the user comfortable and seemless. I have utilized a referenced variable throughtout the last few programs I have made specifically for exiting the while loop in main. I implement it such that its value performs a purpose in functions and also dictates the while loop.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I previously utilized a method of "press any key to continue" that acquired what was in the input buffer instead of waiting for the user to hit enter. It would make the program more efficient with transitions by a bit. I know there's some dereferencing the Python code with C++ which I am not to familiar with, but should be added when I learn more aobut it.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found working with the Python code in C++ extremely challenging, despite most of the groundwork existing in the starter files. It took me a good amount of time to figure out how to properly call my Python functions and what arguments needed to be sent and to differentiate between all the various C++ Python calls that exist. I eventually overcame it by reading the referencce library material, which did not give me much insight, but I also viewed various examples of C+ Python calls in action. Those helped me immensely once I looked at the Python call definitions in their library, as it told me what type the arguments had to be in order to work. I am definitely more attuned with utilizng library definitions, especially when starter code has me using functions I have no clue of how to use.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Utilizing reference material is something I am not the best at, but at least I know I can find a baseline of knowledge for a certain portion of a language. I am sure it will be very important for me to be able to do that and search through different innate functions to find one that can suit my needs. I had struggled to make C++ and Python cooperate only because I did not understand the functions required to do so. Now I do, and I see how it can be beneficial to utilize more languages as necessary. I hope to do more multi language assignments to see my skills improve further.




**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
